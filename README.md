I am Siddesh Vaishnav, a student and emerging professional at the intersection of Data Science and Software Development. My academic focus centers on statistics, analytics, and computational problem-solving, supported by a project-driven approach to programming and data analysis.

My technical competencies include data manipulation and analysis with Python (Pandas, SQL), development of interactive applications using Java, Flask, and Streamlit, and visualization and reporting with Tableau and Excel. I am strengthening my theoretical foundation through preparation for the IIT JAM exam in Statistics and Mathematics.

I have delivered analytical and engineering outcomes across multiple domains:

Exploratory Data Analysis Projects: Performed comprehensive EDA on real-world datasets to identify patterns, trends, and actionable insights, accompanied by dashboard generation and structured reporting.

Application Development: Engineered software artifacts including a Java-based 2D game with core mechanics, state persistence, and interactive systems.

Data Engineering and SQL Integration: Constructed robust SQL workflows to support analytical tasks and ensure data integrity.

My workflow emphasizes rigorous analysis, reproducibility, and clarity of results. I pursue contributions that reinforce evidence-based decisions and system reliability.
